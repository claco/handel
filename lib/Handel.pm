Handel - Simple commerce framework with AxKit support

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Handel is a quick and not-so-dirty ecommerce framework with L<AxKit> taglib
support. It was started for the conversion of an IIS/ASP based commerce site to
Apache/ModPerl, but I decided that is might be usefull to others so here it is
on CPAN.

For the curious, Handel is German for commerce.
